# Hola-Folks
This is the first repo I have ever created. Bursting with curiosity!
Bravo! I just now learned a new word called "bravo". And I also started learning coding in web development. I'm a complete novice in computer programming but feel interested in it.
I read the book written by John Sonmez on how to become a software developer in the morning. In the sectoin of developing technical skills, he addressed that it is paramount to have an idea of the technology you are going to learn. I think that is helpful in guiding a starter to learn something new. I am currently learning JavaScript and this tip will definitely help a lot.
