# Hola-Folks
This is the first repo I have ever created. Bursting with curiosity!
Bravo! I just now learned a new word called "bravo". And I also started learning coding in web development. I'm a complete novice in computer programming but feel interested in it.
I read the book written by John Sonmez on how to become a software developer in the morning. In the sectoin of developing technical skills, he addressed that it is paramount to have an idea of the technology you are going to learn. I think that is helpful in guiding a starter to learn something new. I am currently learning JavaScript and this tip will definitely help a lot.
I also read a book written by Haruki Murakami about his thinking on running. Literally, as he writes in the book, there is not very much thinking going on in the brain as he is jogging. I have the same feeling. I jog on the trail along the river, smell the morning mist, see sunny scenery passing by, greeting with other people and feel heartbeat and breath.
